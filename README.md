# Trending YouTube Video Statistics 

The following report is designed to provide insights on the differences between trending videos from YouTube United States (US) and Great Brutain (GB).

To do so, we will analyse the YouTube list of top trending videos for each country, and aim to answer the following questions:

- How many trending videos have been selected from both countries over time?
- Which are the mostly viewed trending videos?
- Which are the most commented trending videos?
- What is the average number of views of trending videos per country?
- How have the number of views behaved overtime?
- What is the average number of likes per video for the US and GB per year?
- How have the number of likes behaved overtime?
- What is the median like-dislike ratio for all the videos in both countries?
- What is the category which displays the higher number of views per country?
- Is there a relationship between the number of views and number of likes by category?
- Do videos which are most polarizing get shared the most?

Note: these videos are not necessarily the most-viewed videos overall for the calendar year, but rather the selected videos by YouTube which considers a variety of factors including measuring users interactions (number of views, shares, comments and likes).
